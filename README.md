## What's New in Ver 2.2

- Route Draw
    a. simple.
    b. animation.

- Make sure performance is good by using kotlin coroutine.

- Draw route between origin and destination through waypoints.

- Support to android 30.

- The callback of the complete route draws with time and distance between waypoints and destinations.

# Prerequisites
- Android 16
# Installing
## Step 1:- Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
````
all projects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
  
````
## Step 1:- Add the dependency:
````
        dependencies {
            implementation 'com.github.prabhat1707:EasyWayLocation:2.2'
        }
    
````

# Usage

###### If the device is running Android 6.0 or higher, and your app's target SDK is 29 or higher then first check the permission of location then call it.

## Add the required permissions
For fine location (GPS location), add the following permission in your AndroidManifest.xml:
````
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

````

For coarse location (network location), add the following permission in your AndroidManifest.xml:
````
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

````

# Retrieve the location from the device
````
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements Listener {
    EasyWayLocation easyWayLocation;
    private TextView location, latLong, diff;
    private Double lati, longi;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        //--
        easyWayLocation = new EasyWayLocation(this, false,false,this);
    }

    @Override
    public void locationOn() {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Location ON", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();    
    }

   @Override
    public void currentLocation(Location location) {
        StringBuilder data = new StringBuilder();
        data.append(location.getLatitude());
        data.append(" , ");
        data.append(location.getLongitude());
        latLong.setText(data);
        getLocationDetail.getAddress(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), "xyz");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void locationCancelled() {
         Toast.makeText(this, "Location Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        switch (requestCode) {
            case LOCATION_SETTING_REQUEST_CODE:
                easyWayLocation.onActivityResult(resultCode);
                break;
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        easyWayLocation.startLocation();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        easyWayLocation.endUpdates();

    }
}

# Location Notifier

````
@Override
    public void locationOn() {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Location ON", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        
    }

    @Override
    public void  currentLocation(Location location){
       // give lat and long at every interval 
    }

    @Override
    public void locationCancelled() {
        // location not on
    }
    
````
# Constructor options

## Points to Remember
- if you want only last location then pass it true and if false then it gives you location update as per default location request.
- if you don't pass then it takes default location request or you can pass your's one also(see constructor 2nd).

````
Context context = this;
boolean requireFineGranularity = false;
new EasyWayLocation(this, requireLastLocation = false,isDebuggable = true/false,listner = this);

or

request = new LocationRequest();
request.setInterval(10000);
request.setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY);

new EasyWayLocation(this,locationRequest = request ,  requireLastLocation = false,isDebuggable = true/false,listner = this);


````

## Calculate distance between two points

````

double startLatitude = 59.95;
double startLongitude = 30.3;
double endLatitude = 44.84;
double endLongitude = -0.58;
location.calculateDistance(startLatitude, startLongitude, endLatitude, endLongitude);

// or

Point startPoint = new EasyWayLocation.Point(59.95, 30.3);
Point endPoint = new EasyWayLocation.Point(44.84, -0.58);
location.calculateDistance(startPoint, endPoint);

````

## Update Get Address Details of location.
- if you want an address from the current location then you need to pass key and context.
- why I want key here if android already provides Geocoder because in some cases or some devices geocoder not work well and throws Exception, so in that case, I use google geocode API for fetch address.
- For this, you need to implement Callback, LocationData.AddressCallBack

````
GetLocationDetail getLocationDetail = new GetLocationDetail(callback = this, context = this);

getLocationDetail.getAddress(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), key = "xyz");

````

## Google Map Route

#### If you want to add map route feature in your apps you can use this along with this lib by adding DirectionUtil Class to make you work more easier. This is lib will help you to draw route maps between two-point LatLng along it's with waypoints.

## In Your GoogleMap Ready

#### Make sure you enable google map and google map direction in the google developer console.

````
wayPoints.add(LatLng(37.423669, -122.090168))
        wayPoints.add(LatLng(37.420930, -122.085362))
                val directionUtil = DirectionUtil.Builder()
                .setDirectionKey("xyz")
                        .setOrigin(LatLng(37.421481, -122.092156))
                        .setWayPoints(wayPoints)
                        .setGoogleMap(mMap)
                        .setPolyLineWidth(8)
                        .setCallback(this)
                        .setDestination(LatLng(37.421519, -122.086809))
                        .build()

        directionUtil.drawPath()

````

# There are two cases in it:

- With Animation like Uber
- without Animation.

1. With Animation

    - setPathAnimation = true

![gif1](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/chatapp-2e1df.appspot.com/o/location%20images%2Fanimation_route.gif?alt=media&token=b46ba82d-956d-4770-822e-bcc5a00b8d3d)

2. Without Animation

    - setPathAnimation = false
    - change its color by, setPolyLinePrimaryColor() property
    
![gif2](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/chatapp-2e1df.appspot.com/o/location%20images%2Fnormal_route.gif?alt=media&token=c0fdf82c-a16d-40e1-8f49-c080e4a621e8)

## Callbacks

#### When route draw path has done then it comes in a callback 

````

override fun pathFindFinish(polyLineDetails: HashMap<String, PolyLineDataBean>) {
       for (i in polyLineDetails.keys){
           Log.v("sample",polyLineDetails[i]?.time)
       }
    }
    
````

here, polyLineDetails contain each polyline or route detail as time, distance and road summary.

#### You can also change the route animation different properties like delay, primary color, a secondary color, etc, just explore it.
